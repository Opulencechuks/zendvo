**Zendvo** is an expense, savings, and gifting platform that transforms digital money transfers into memorable experiences. It enables users to send cash gifts that remain completely hidden and locked until a predetermined date and time, save toward a specific item or goal, and track daily expenses accurately.

## Features

- **Time-Locked Gifting**: Funds are locked in Soroban smart contracts and only released after a specified date and time, enforced entirely on-chain.
- **Stablecoin Preservation**: Uses USDC on Stellar to keep gift value stable from creation to reveal, eliminating volatility risk.
- **Yield on Savings**: Idle savings earn yield through Stellar's AMM liquidity pools or Blend Protocol lending, so balances grow while waiting.
- **Bank Integration**: Seamless on/off-ramps connecting stablecoin liquidity to local bank accounts, with Paystack powering Nigerian NGN payouts.
- **Surprise Experience**: UI/UX built around anticipation, revealing gifts only at the exact unlock moment.
- **Low-Cost Global Transfers**: Stellar's 3–5 second finality and near-zero fees make cross-border gifting practical at any amount.
- **Expense Tracking**: Accurate daily expense calculation with categorization and spending summaries.

## Stellar Integration

Zendvo uses the Stellar ecosystem for its core financial primitives:

| Feature | Stellar Primitive |
|---|---|
| Time-locked gifts | Soroban smart contracts with `time_lock` logic |
| Stable transfers | USDC (Circle) on Stellar |
| Savings yield | Stellar AMM pools / Blend Protocol |
| Low-fee settlement | Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) |
| On/off-ramp | Anchor-compatible deposit/withdrawal |

> [!NOTE]
> Stellar does not have native proof-of-stake staking. Yield on savings is earned through liquidity provision in Stellar's built-in AMM or via the Blend Protocol lending market — both non-custodial and on-chain.

## Quick Start

This project is set up as an **NPM Workspaces Monorepo**. Dependencies are hoisted and both servers can be run concurrently.

1. **Clone and prepare**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codeze-us/zendvo.git
   cd zendvo
   # Copy and configure environment variables in the backend folder
   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (installs and hoists packages for both workspaces):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database setup** (runs Drizzle Kit from the backend workspace):
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   ```

4. **Run in development** (starts Next.js on port `3000` and Express on port `5000` concurrently):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
